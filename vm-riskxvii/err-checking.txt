CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ...

Allow accessing across border between consecutive allocation chunks

malloc call with size zero:
* Error - Return null pointer

PC Exceeds instruction memory (above or below bounds):
* Throw error

Memory access outside bounds:
* Allow read access to instruction, data, and allocated heap memory
* Allow wrtie access to data and allocated heap memory
* Allow access across valid data sections

Invalid int given for virtual routine 'read int' AND read char:
* Uses returned value of scanf("%d"), may be -1, may be undefined
* Continues with this value without error

Register overflow:
* Follow system dependent behaviour

Error checks file opening and reading:
* Ensure exactly one CL input given
* File size must be exactly 2048
* Exits on fopen/fread/... errors

Negative number, or n > size, given for shift ammount in bit shift instructions:
* Set value to all zeroes but continue without error
* allow n > size for sra, but crop shift
